461. Hamming Distance

C++语言:

第一种方法:

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int diff,res=0;
        diff=x^y;
        while(diff)
        {
            if(diff & 1)
                res++;
            diff >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

第二种方法：

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int diff,res=0;
        diff=x^y;
        while (diff) 
        {
            ++res;
            diff &= diff - 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

Python语言:

第一种方法：

class Solution(object):
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        res=0
        diff=x^y
        while diff != 0 :
            if diff & 1 !=0 :
                res += 1
            diff >>= 1
        return res; 

第二种方法：

class Solution(object):
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        return bin(x^y).count('1')
